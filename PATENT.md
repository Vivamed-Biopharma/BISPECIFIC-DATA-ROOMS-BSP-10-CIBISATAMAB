# BSP-10-CIBISATAMAB

**Summary:** The invention describes a novel variant of the bispecific antibody cibisatamab engineered with glycoform-selective CEA binding domains to minimize gastrointestinal toxicity while maintaining efficacy in colorectal cancer.

**Patentability Score:** 8.0/10
**In-Silico Score:** 9.0/10
**Gemini rNPV:** $250.0M

**Patentability Analysis:**
The invention addresses the known dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity of cibisatamab (CEA-TCB) by introducing a tumor-selective binding mechanism based on differential glycosylation. While cibisatamab and anti-CEA antibodies (like Sm3e, which the provided VH/VL resembles) are prior art, the specific engineering for glycoform selectivity to differentiate tumor CEA from normal epithelial CEA represents a novel and non-obvious improvement. This 'bio-better' approach creates a strong position for a selection invention or improvement patent.

**In-Silico Analysis:**
The application utilizes a state-of-the-art computational pipeline, including Boltz-2 (AlphaFold3 derivative) for structure prediction, DiffDock-L for binding poses, and Aggrescan3D for developability. The inclusion of specific validation metrics (solubility >0.85, Tm >65°C) and immunogenicity screening (DeepImmuno) demonstrates comprehensive in silico enablement beyond simple sequence generation.
